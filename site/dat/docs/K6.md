# K6 Executor

[K6](https://k6.io/) is a load testing tool, which allows to run javascript tests.

Taurus can loop test suite execution in a loop until `hold-for` time will be exceeded.

Usage:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: molotov
  concurrency: 10  # number of K6 workers
  hold-for: 1m
  iterations: 20
  scenario:
    script: k6-test.js  # has to be a valid K6 script
```
