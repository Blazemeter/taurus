# K6 Executor

`k6` executor allows running [K6](https://k6.io/) based test suites.

In order to launch K6 executor, you can use yaml config like in the example below

Example:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: k6
  concurrency: 10  # number of K6 workers
  hold-for: 1m  # execution duration
  iterations: 20  # number of iterations
  scenario:
    script: k6-test.js  # has to be a valid K6 script
```

For scenarios defined within the K6 script itself you can use the example below

Example:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: k6
  scenario:
    script: k6-test.js  # has to be a valid K6 script
```

Please keep in mind that it is necessary to provide a valid script to run tests.

## Script Example

This is an example of a valid script from [K6 website](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/running-k6):

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://blazedemo.com/');
  sleep(1);
}
```
## Command-line Settings
You can specify special cli options for K6, for example:
```yaml
modules:
  k6:
    cmdline: --out json=result.json
```
