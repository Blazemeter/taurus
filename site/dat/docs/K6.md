# K6 Executor

Use the `k6` executor to run [Grafana Cloud k6](https://k6.io/) based test suites.

In order to launch the Grafana Cloud k6 executor, use a YAML config like in the following example:

Example:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: k6
  concurrency: 10  # number of K6 workers
  hold-for: 1m     # execution duration
  iterations: 20   # number of iterations
  ramp-up: 60s     # 
  scenario: k6Test

scenarios
  k6Test:
    script: k6-test.js  # has to be a valid K6 script
```

Important: Provide a valid K6 script to run tests.

## Script Example

This is an example of a valid script from the [K6 website](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/examples/get-started-with-k6/):

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://blazedemo.com/');
  sleep(1);
}
```
## Command-line Settings
You can specify special cli options for K6, for example:
```yaml
modules:
  k6:
    cmdline: --out json=result.json
```
