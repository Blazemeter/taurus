# Apiritif
Allows to run load and functional Python tests using [Apiritif test framework](https://github.com/Blazemeter/apiritif),
which is based on [Nose library](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
You can run Nose tests the following way:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: apiritif
  scenario:
    script: test_nose.py
```
Also, if not present, Taurus creates and stores Nose test to the artifacts directory, when Apiritif executor is used.

Taurus can loop test suite execution in a loop until desired number of `iterations` will complete or `hold-for` time
will be exceeded.

Usage:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: apiritif
  scenario:
    script: tests/
```

It allows you to use some logic blocks:
- `transactions`: collect requests in one block
- `set-variables`: set/change value of variable
- `include-scenario`: include scenario into another one

and CSV data sources. Use following format to specify them:
```yaml
scenarios:
  sample:
    variables:
      var1: val1
    requests:
    - http://blazedemo.com     # ordinal request
    - transaction: second   # transaction
      do:
      - http://blazedemo.com/send
      - http://blazedemo.com/receive/${var1} # get 'receive/val2'
      - set-variables:  # change variable value
          var1: val2
      - http://blazedemo.com/receive/${var1} # get 'receive/val2'
    - include-scenario: inner

    data-sources: # list of external data sources
    - path/to/my.csv  # this is a shorthand form
    - path: path/to/another.csv  # this is full form, path option is required
      delimiter: ';'  # CSV delimiter, auto-detected by default
      quoted: false  # allow quoted data
      loop: true  # loop over in case of end-of-file reached if true, stop thread if false
      variable-names: id,name  # delimiter-separated list of variable names, empty by default

  inner:
    requests:
    - set-variables:
        var1: val3
    - http://blazedemo.com/receive/${var1}
```

It is valid to specify both single Python module (single .py file) and a Python package (folder with Python modules
and packages).

Configuration options:

```yaml
modules:
  apiritif:
    working-dir: classes  # set name of runner working directory within artifacts dir
    interpreter: /home/user/interpreter/python  # path to custom interpreter.
```
## Scenario
Apiritif executor supports building test script from the `requests` option of `scenario`. In that case Taurus will
generate a Python script that will be launched with `apiritif`.

With `Apiritif` executor you can ask for Selenium browser test with `test-mode` option:

```yaml
execution:
- executor: apiritif
  test-mode: selenium
```

In `selenium` mode follow request features are supported:

  - `browser` for the following browser types: Chrome, Firefox, Ie, Opera, Android-Chrome, iOS-Safari, Remote
  - `remote` for local webdriver, local remote webdriver or [remote webdriver](#Remote-WebDriver)
  - `capabilities` of [remote webdriver](#Remote-WebDriver): `browser`, `version`, `javascript`, `platform`, `os\_version`, `selenium`, `device`, `app`
  - `request` only for GET method
      - `action` keyword for Selenium actions
      - `assert` (requested page source inspected use the new assertTitle, assertTextBy or assertValueBy* for item level)
  - `timeout` and `think-time` on both scenario and request levels

Here is the list of supported actions, sorted by action type.

### Locators
Below you will see some actions, which look like this: `actionX`, i.e. `dragByX`, `clickBy`, etc. Here `X` means a certain
action object. It can be one of the following: `ID`, `Name`, `LinkText`, `CSS`, `XPath`. For example, `clickByID`,
`waitByName`, `keysByCSS`.

#### How to find them
__1. By ID__

```html
<td>
    <h1 id="my_locator_ID">Locator ID</h1>
</td>
```
Header tag has an ID attribute (`id="Locator\_ID"`). For example, wait until the element is displayed `waitByID(Locator\_ID)`.

__2. By the attribute Name__

```html
<input name="inputName">
```

This is an input element and it has attribute `name="inputName"`.

For example, insert text the following in the input `keysByName(inputName): First\_Name`. Locator determination by the attribute `Name` is often used when working with input fields.

__3. By CSS Selector__

CSS is used for styling different elements of an HTML webpage, to separate the content of the page and its design.
The .css files define these styles, set font size, width, height, etc. There are certain patterns in the CSS, which act
as selectors and are applied to HTML elements of the page. Selenium uses the same principle to find
items.

Here is an example. This is how to find div with input.
```html
<div class="controls">
    <input id="inputName" placeholder="First Last" name="inputName" type="text">
</div>
```
This CSS selector .controls will select all elements with class `controls`. For example, wait until the element is displayed `waitByCSS(.controls)`.
Using attributes and their value
```html
 <input id="inputName" placeholder="First Last" name="inputName" type="text">
```

Find the element by `name="inputName"`. For example, `keysByCSS(#inputName): First Name`


__4. Using ID__

Find the field for input name with `id="inputName"`

`\<input id="inputName" placeholder="First Last" name="inputName" type="text">`

CSS selector - `#inputName`. Fox example, add text in the field `keysByCSS(#inputName): first\_name`

__5. Child elements__
```html
<div class="controls">
    <input id="inputName" placeholder="First Last" name="inputName" type="text">
</div>
```
Find child element INPUT with `id="inputName"` in the div with `class="controls"`. Describe as `div.controls>input#inputName`. For example, `keysByCSS(div.controls>input#inputName): first\_name`

__6. By XPath__

XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML can be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium can use this language to find elements for the web page. One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don't have a suitable id or name attribute for the element you wish to locate. To locate the element we can use absolute XPath or use relative path elements that have attributes id, name etc.

For INPUT
```html
<div class="controls">
    <input placeholder="First Last" type="text">
</div>
```

We can compose following XPath expressions:
 - `//div/input`
 - `//div\[@class="controls"]/input`

Any of these expressions can be used to fetch the desired element, if these attributes are unique.

### Alternative syntax supporting multiple locators
It is possible to specify multiple locators for each action. This helps to increase script resiliency. If a locator
fails (e.g. because of a webpage change and the script was not updated to reflect the changes) an alternative locator
will be used. If no locator succeeds then the script fails.
All the locators above are supported, i.e. `ID`, `Name`, `LinkText`, `CSS`, `XPath`.


This is an example how it looks like:
```yaml
  - type: select  # action name
    param: American Express # parameter for the select action
    locators:     # list of locators for the action, these are attempted one by one from top to bottom
      - id: select_id           # locator types are case insensitive
      - css: another_class    
      - xpath: absolute_xpath
      - xpath: relative_xpath   # there may be multiple locators of the same type
      - name: select_name
```
You can see full example [here](#Sample-scenario-using-multiple-locators).

##### If Blocks

Apiritif allows to control execution flow using `if` blocks. These blocks enable 
conditional execution of actions.

Each `if` block should contain a mandatory `then` field, and an optional `else` field. Both `then` and `else` fields
should contain list of actions.

Here's a simple example:

```yaml
scenarios:
  example:
    browser: Chrome
    variables:
      elem_id: id_123
    timeout: 10s
    requests:
      - label: example1
        actions:
          - go(http://blazedemo.com)
          - if: 'document.getElementById("${elem_id}") !== undefined'
            then:
              - clickById(${elem_id})
            else:
              - go(http://blazedemo.com/login)
```

Logic blocks can also be nested:

```yaml
scenarios:
  nested_example:
    requests:
      - label: nested_req
        actions:
          - if: <condition1>
            then:
              - if: <condition2>
                then:
                  - go(https://google.com/)
                else:
                  - go(https://yahoo.com/)
            else:
              - go(https://bing.com/)
```

Note that `<conditions>` are evaluated as JavaScript code so they must contain valid JavaScript expression 
that yields boolean value.

### Loops

`Loop` blocks allow repeated execution of actions. 

It is necessary to specify variable name used in the loop,
along with the `start` and `end` indexes. The actions that shall be executed in the loop are defined in the `do` field.
In these action you can then reference the variable by the name you defined next to the `loop` keyword.
 
Optionally you can set the `step` field which defines the difference between each number in the sequence 
(it can also be negative). If `step` is not explicitly set then it will default to 1.

```yaml
scenarios:
  example:
    browser: Chrome
    timeout: 10s
    requests:
      - label: example_loop
        actions:
          - go(http://blazedemo.com)
          - loop: var_i
            start: 1
            end: 10
            do:
              - clickById(id_${var_i})
              - typeById(input_${var_i}): My Item ${var_i} 
``` 

Note that both the `start` and `end` index are included in the loop. So for 
example setting `start` to 1 and `end` to 5 will loop through these values: \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\].

It is also possible to specify the `step` negative. In that case the loop will go from the higher 
numbers to the lower ones. However it is also necessary that the `start` index is higher than the 
`end` index. 

For example:

```yaml
  - loop: i
    start: 5
    end: 1
    step: -1
    do: 
      - clickById(id_${i})
``` 
This will loop through the values \[5, 4, 3, 2, 1\] in the descending order.


### Alert
For alert handling, use the following methods:
- `alert("OK")` to click "OK" on an alert
- `alert("Dismiss")` to dismiss alert
 
Besides, you can use [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators):

```yaml
- type: alert
  param: OK
```

### Assertion
For requested page source inspection you can use the following actions:
- `assertTextByX(X\_name): "text"` to assert text to an element
- `assertValueByX(X\_name): value` to assert value
- `assertTitle(title)` to assert page title
- `assertEval(js_expr)` to assert that evaluation of a JavaScript expression returns true value

Don't forget to replace `X` with the right [locators](#Locators).
See sample usage in [Frame Management](#Frame-management) section.

For assertion you can also use special assertion block. See example [here](#Sample-scenario).

Using the [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators): 
```yaml
- type: assertText
  param: text
  locators:
    - id: element_id
    - xpath: /xpath
- type: assertValue
  param: value
  locators:
    - id: element_id
- type: assertTitle
  param: title
- type: assertEval
  param: js_expr
```

### Cookies
To delete all cookies use `clearCookies()` action.

The same can be written like this: 
```yaml
- type: clearCookies
```

### Echoing
Use `echoString("echoed text")` to print text string on the Apiritif output execution.

Or you may use:
```yaml
- type: echoString
  param: echoed text
```

### Editing
`editContentByX(X\_name): "new test for X"` will help you change text in an editable field.

Or by using the [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators):
```yaml
- type: editContent
  param: new text for X
  locators:
    - css: element_class
```

### Execution
For execution of a non-yaml code you can use the following options:
- `scriptEval("script")` to execute JS command like this
```yaml
scriptEval("alert('This is a JavaScript command.');")
```
Which can be written also like:
```yaml
- type: scriptEval
  param: alert('This is a JavaScript command.')
```
- `rawCode: Python code` to insert python code as it is.
```yaml
rawCode: print('This is a python command.')
```

```yaml
- type: rawCode
  param: print('This is a python command.')
```

See example [here](#Sample-scenario).


### Frame management
When you need to perform actions on elements that are inside a frame or iframe, you must use the `switchFrame` command
to activate the frame before perform any action.

Sample usage:
```yaml
scenarios:
  sample_frame:
    requests:
    - url: http://a-frame-sample.com
      actions:
      - switchFrame(index=0) # Select First Frame
      - assertTextByCSS(body): "First Frame Body"
      - switchFrame(relative=parent) # Go to parent
      - switchFrame(index=1) # Select Second frame
      - switchFrame(index=0) # Nested Frame, Select the First frame inside the Top Second frame
      - assertTextByID(content): "First Frame Body inside Second Frame Body"
      - switchFrame(relative=top) # Go to top frame (main document)
```
Note: For first level frames, it is possible to use `switchFrameByX` and using selector to match the frame to switch.

Disclaimer: Currently there are problems in the support of this functionality by geckodriver and chromedriver, depending on the case to test some of these methods can generate a failure, mainly in cases where you have nested frames or frames mixed between frame and iframes.

It is also possible to use the alternative syntax for Frame management, however there is currently no support for multiple locators:
```yaml
- type: switchFrame
  param: index=0
- type: switchFrame
  param: relative=parent
- type: switchFrameByName
  param: frame_name
```

### Go
Use `go(url)` to redirect to another website.
```yaml
- type: go
  param: url
```

### Mouse actions
For mouse imitating actions you can use the following:
- `clickByX(X\_name)`
- `doubleClickByX(X\_name)`
- `mouseDownByX(X\_name)`
- `mouseUpByX(X\_name)`
- `mouseOutByX(X\_name)`
- `mouseOverByX(X\_name)`
- `dragByX(X\_name): elementByX(another\_X\_name)`

`X` here is for one of [locators](#Locators).

Or by using the [multiple locators](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators) syntax:
```yaml
- type: click
  locators:
     - css: element_class
     - xpath: /xpath/
- type: doubleClick
  locators:
     - css: element_class
     - xpath: /xpath/
- type: mouseDown
  locators:
     - css: element_class
     - xpath: /xpath/
- type: mouseUp
  locators:
     - css: element_class
     - xpath: /xpath/
- type: mouseOut
  locators:
     - css: element_class
     - xpath: /xpath/
- type: mouseOver
  locators:
     - css: element_class
     - xpath: /xpath/
- type: drag
  source:
    - name: element_name
    - xpath: /xpath/
  target:
    - css: element_css
    - xpath: /xpath/
```

### Pause
For pause you can use the following actions:
- `waitByX(X\_name)` to wait for presence or `waitByX(X\_name): visible` to wait for visibility

You can also define wait using the [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators) to provide multiple locators:
```yaml
- type: wait
  locators: 
    - css: element_class
    - id: element_id
- type: wait
  param: visible
  locators:
    - css: element_class    
```
- `pauseFor(time)`
```yaml
- type: pauseFor
  param: time
```

`X` here is for one of [locators](#Locators).

### Screenshot
To take a screenshot of a viewport and save it in a file use this: `screenshot(file\_name)`

Or like this by using the [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators):

```yaml
- type: screenshot
  param: file_name
```

### Select
To select a value use this: `selectByX(X\_name): value`.

See documentation for `X` [here](#Locators).

Or by using the [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators):
```yaml
- type: select
  param: value
  locators:
    - id: element_id
```

### Store
For storing variables use the following actions:
- `storeTitle(): var_title`
- `storeString(value): "var_string"`
- `storeTextByX(X\_name): "var_text"`
- `storeValueByX(X\_name): var_value`

See documentation for `X` [here](#Locators).

For storing the result of evaluation of a JavaScript expression use:

- `storeEval(js_expr): var_eval`

The following example will store to the `el_present` variable a flag indicating
whether the find element by id was successful or not:
- `storeEval(document.getElementById("elem_id") !== undefined): el_present`

Or use the [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators):
```yaml
- type: storeTitle
  param: var_title
- type: storeString
  param: var_string
  value: value
- type: storeText
  param: var_text
  locators:
    - id: element_id  
- type: storeValue
  param: var_value
  locators:
    - id: element_id
- type: storeEval
  param: var_eval
  value: js_expr
```

### Typing
Typing actions are the following:
- `typeByX(X\_name): "text\_to\_type"` clears `X` value and then types text.
- `submitByX(X\_name)`
- `keysByX(X\_name): value` sends keystrokes to `X`. `value` can be formed like this: `KEY\_ENTER`. See docs for it [here](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html#module-selenium.webdriver.common.keys).

`X` here is for one of [locators](#Locators).

Typing actions with [multiple locators support](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators):
```yaml
- type: type
  param: text_to_type
  locators:
    - css: input_css
    - name: input_name
- type: submit
  locators:
    - id: element_id
- type: keys
  param: KEY_ENTER
  locators:
    - id: element_id  
```

### Window management
To manage windows or tabs, the `switchWindow(value)` and `closeWindow(value)` commands will allow you to manage them.

These actions require a value parameter, the possible values are:
  - `number`: The index to the window in reference, 0 is the first, 1 is the second, and so with those who want to manage.
  - `name`: The name of the window (reference to the name used in the target window attribute in a link).
  - `win\_ser\_name`: In the `name` part, assign a name to the focused opened window, the next time when reference to the same window name, returns with focus to the named window selected.
  - `win\_ser\_local`: Go to the initial window.
  - `no value`: When no value is assigned, it means that the selection action is assigned over the last created window, and if the close action is used, it will also be over the last one created.

Note: When any action command opens a new window (like click over a link with target window assigned), the action of selecting the window must always be declared, otherwise the actions executed by the execution were performed on the default window or the last one used with selectWindow command.

Or using the [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators):
```yaml
- type: switchWindow
  param: value
- type: closeWindow
  param: value
```

### Sample scenario
```yaml
scenarios:
  request_example:
    browser: Firefox  # available browsers are: ["Firefox", "Chrome", "Ie", "Opera"]
    headless: true  # available only for Chrome/Firefox and only on Selenium 3.8.0+, disabled by default
    timeout: 10  #  global scenario timeout for connecting, receiving results, 30 seconds by default
    think-time: 1s500ms  # global scenario delay between each request
    default-address: http://blazedemo.com/  # specify a base address, so you can use short urls in requests
    requests:
    - url: /  # url to open, only get method is supported
      actions:  # holds list of actions to perform
      - waitByCSS(body)
      - clickByID(mySubmitButton)
      - openWindow(http://blazedemo.com/vacation.html) # new window is created (#1)
      - switchWindow(1)     # switch to the second window (#0)
      - resizeWindow(750, 750) # change window size to x, y
      - maximizeWindow() # change window size to maximum
      - closeWindow()      # close the second window (#1)
      - pauseFor(5s)
      - clearCookies()
      - keysByName(myInputName): keys_to_type
      - submitByName(myInputName)
      - waitByID(myObjectToAppear): visible
      - scriptEval("alert('This is Sparta');")
      - rawCode: print('It\'s Python')  # insert as-is into script file
      - rawCode: |
          for i in range(10):           # multiline example
            if i % 2 == 0:
              print(i)
      assert: # assert executed after actions
      - contains:
        - blazemeter  # list of search patterns
        - Trusted
        subject: body # only body subject supported
        regexp: false  # treat string as regular expression
        not: false  # inverse assertion condition
```
All action names are case insensitive. Despite it misprint in action names or usage of unsupported actions break your scenario execution.
To avoid it you can use `ignore-unknown-actions` Apiritif flag and taurus will show warning when unknown action occurs.
```yaml
scenarios:
  sample:
    requests:
    - url: http://blazedemo.com
      actions:
      - definitelyUnknownAction(unknownSelector)
modules:
  apiritif:
    ignore-unknown-actions: True

```

### Sample scenario using multiple locators

When using multiple locators [alternative syntax](#Alternative-syntax-supporting-multiple-locators) it is possible to 
mix it with the shorter version of action definition.

```yaml
scenarios:
  request_example:
    browser: Firefox  # available browsers are: ["Firefox", "Chrome", "Ie", "Opera"]
    headless: true  # available only for Chrome/Firefox and only on Selenium 3.8.0+, disabled by default
    timeout: 10  #  global scenario timeout for connecting, receiving results, 30 seconds by default
    think-time: 1s500ms  # global scenario delay between each request
    default-address: http://blazedemo.com/  # specify a base address, so you can use short urls in requests
    requests:
    - url: /  # url to open, only get method is supported
      actions:  # holds list of actions to perform
      - type: wait
        locators:
          - css: body
          - xpath: /body/
      - type: click
        locators:
          - id: mySubmitButton
          - linktext: Submit Form
          - css: btn_primary
      - openWindow(http://blazedemo.com/vacation.html)
      - clearCookies()
      - type: keys
        param: keys_to_type
        locators:
          - name: myInputName
      - type: submit
        locators:
          - name: myInputName
      - type: wait
        param: visible
        locators:
          - id: myObjectToAppear
          - name: myObjectToAppearName
      - scriptEval("alert('This is Sparta');")
      - type: rawCode
        param: print('It\'s Python')  # insert as-is into script file
      assert: # assert executed after actions
      - contains:
        - blazemeter  # list of search patterns
        - Trusted
        subject: body # only body subject supported
        regexp: false  # treat string as regular expression
        not: false  # inverse assertion condition
```


## Variables

It is possible to define variables to be used in the script, declaring them at the scenario level.

To use it, simply in any reference to a text in the script you must declare the insertion of the variable by using ```${name}```

The use of variables can be used in many reference locations, in selectors or in values.
There are also commands that allow you to store and manipulate them.
Some of them are `storeTitle`, `storeTextBy \*`, `storeValueBy \*` and `storeString`.

Sample:
```yaml
scenario:
  sample:
    variables:
        sample: The is a sample site you can test with BlazeMeter!
    requests:
    - url: http://blazedemo.com/
      actions:
      - assertTextByCSS(body > div.jumbotron > div > p:nth-child(2)): ${sample}
      - storeTitle(): my_title
      - storeTextByXPath(//my/XPath/here): my_text
      - storeValueByXPath(//my/XPath/here): my_value

## Remote WebDriver

It is possible to use the browser remotely using Remote WebDriver. It must be indicated as the browser name `Remote` and indicate in the `remote` property the URL in which the webdriver service is located to control the browser.

To specify the capabilities of the Remote WebDriver, it is necessary to be able to configure properties necessary for remote instantiation. You must use the `capabilities` structure where you can specify the main properties required by the remote webdriver.

Note: The capabilities are a way in which the remote service filters and selects the device or browser to be selected for the test, depending on its configuration according to the configured specifications. It is recommended to read the documentation of who provides the service

### Commonly used capabilities

  - browser
  - version
  - platform
  - device # Id of the device (Mobile browser)
  - os_version # commonly used only for mobile

Note: Currently it is possible to perform basic tests in mobile browsers using the available actions commands, in the future more commands related to mobile will be incorporated to allow a better interactivity.

### Sample Remote Webdriver scenario:
```yaml
scenarios:
  request_example:
    browser: Remote
    remote: http://user:key@remote_web_driver_host:port/wd/hub
    capabilities:
      browser: firefox  # Depends on the capabilities of the remote selenium server
      version: "54.0"
    requests:
    - url: http://demo.blazemeter.com  # url to open, only get method is supported
      actions:  # holds list of actions to perform
      - waitByCSS(body)
    # ...
```
It is possible to use only the `remote` option, and in this way declare the intention to use the `browser: Remote`, allowing a more compact YAML.

Sample usage of `remote` without `browser: Remote` clause declaration:
```yaml
scenarios:
  request_example:
    remote: http://user:key@remote_web_driver_host:port/wd/hub
    capabilities:
      browser: firefox  # Depends on the capabilities of the remote selenium server
      version: "54.0"
    requests:
    - url: http://demo.blazemeter.com  # url to open, only get method is supported
      actions:  # holds list of actions to perform
      - waitByCSS(body)
    # ...
```

Note that `remote` keyword can be used on module settings, execution settings, or scenario level.

## Mobile Browsers

It is also possible to perform tests on mobile browsers. Currently the browsers supported are `Chrome-Android` and `Safari-iOS`.
Mobile test services are provided by Appium, and it is possible to use Appium locally or some remote Appium service through the Remote WebDriver capability.

Note: Taurus provides the ability to provide Appium provisioning support, it is recommended to read the documentation related to [Selenium Executor / Appium](Selenium.md#appium)

### Sample Mobile Browser scenario:
```yaml
scenarios:
  request_example:
    browser: Chrome-Android
    capabilities:
      device: id_device # set the id of the device here (adb devices)
      remote: custom_appium_url # You can specify a custom url
    timeout: 10  #  global scenario timeout for connecting, receiving results, 30 seconds by default
    think-time: 1s500ms  # global scenario delay between each request
    default-address: http://demo.blazemeter.com  # specify a base address, so you can use short urls in requests
    requests:
    - url: /  # url to open, only get method is supported
      actions:  # holds list of actions to perform
      - waitByCSS(body)
      - clickByID(mySubmitButton)
      - pauseFor(5s)
      - clearCookies()
      - keysByName(myInputName): keys_to_type
      - waitByID(myObjectToAppear): visible
      assert: # assert executed after actions
      - contains:
        - blazemeter  # list of search patterns
        - Trusted
        subject: body # only body subject supported
        regexp: false  # treat string as regular expression
        not: false  # inverse assertion condition

services:
- appium
- android-emulator

modules:
  android-emulator:
    avd: android10_arm128
```

## Reporting
It is recommended to incorporate the use of the `final-stats` module with the option enabled `summary-labels` to have a better vision of results.
It will allow to visualize the status of the tests, the average time per transaction and to visualize the errors that may occur in webdriver and other components involved in the test.

Sample configuration:
```yaml
reporting:
- module: final-stats
  summary-labels: true
```
Sample output:
```
+-----------------+--------+---------+----------+-------+
| label           | status | success | avg time | error |
+-----------------+--------+---------+----------+-------+
| Find Flights    |   OK   | 100.00% |  10.581  |       |
| Reserve Flight  |   OK   | 100.00% |  1.276   |       |
| Purchase Flight |   OK   | 100.00% |  4.951   |       |
| Thanks          |   OK   | 100.00% |  0.062   |       |
+-----------------+--------+---------+----------+-------+
```

### Flow Markers

Functional test execution in the cloud requires additional metadata about the tests,
which can be provided by flow markers. Flow markers are little pieces of code added
by the Taurus to the test script that provide more data for the test execution engine.
Generating flow markers is disabled by default and enabled only for `browser: Remote`.

You can enable/disable it manually with `generate-flow-markers` option.
It can be used on both scenario-level and settings-level.

```yaml
scenarios:
  request_example:
    browser: Chrome
    generate-flow-markers: true  # scenario-specific setting
    requests:
    - url: http://blazedemo.com/
      actions:
      - waitByCSS(body)
      - clickByID(mySubmitButton)
      - pauseFor(5s)

modules:
  apiritif:
    generate-flow-markers: true  # global setting
```
