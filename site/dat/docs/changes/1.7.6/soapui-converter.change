Added a converter utility `soapui2yaml` for converting SoapUI projects into Taurus configs.

Features:
- Converts the whole SoapUI project into a set of scenarios and executions
- Supports extracting a single test case from the SoapUI project
- Extracts HTTP/REST requests and some of their features (HTTP headers, request body, assertions about results, etc)
