Support additional `variable-names` option for JMeter's `data-sources`.

`variable-names` field corresponds to JMeter's `CSVDataSet.variableNames` property.

jmx2yaml was also updated to correctly translate JMeter's `CSVDataSet.variableNames` into Taurus's `variable-names`.

Example:

```yaml
scenarios:
  sample:
    data-sources:
    - path: stuff.csv
      variable-names: id,name,path
    requests:
    - http://blazedemo.com/${path}
```
