# Tsung Executor

## About

[Tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/) is an open-source multi-protocol distributed load testing tool.
The purpose of Tsung is to simulate users in order to test the scalability and performance of IP based client/server
applications. You can use it to do load and stress testing of your servers.

Taurus supports only Tsung version 1.5.1 and higher.

## Tsung Installation

To install Tsung, see official [Tsung Installation](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/user_manual/installation.html) docs.

### Mac OS X

On Mac OS X you can install Tsung with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```bash
$ brew install tsung
```

## Tsung Load Generation Model

When given `concurrency: N`, Tsung spawns N "virtual users" each second. Every user is actually a lightweight Erlang
process. User executes all requests from given scenario and then stops.

## Scenario Samples

Example of using constant `concurrency` and `hold-for`:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: tsung
  concurrency: 100
  hold-for: 1m
  scenario: sample
  
scenarios:
  sample:
    default-address: http://blazedemo.com
    requests:
      - /
      - /reserve.php
```

Example of using user's Tsung config:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: tsung
  scenario: sample
   
scenarios:
  sample:
    script: tsung/http_simple.xml
```

If you specify both scenario `script` and load profile (`concurrency` and `hold-for`) â€” Taurus will copy your Tsung
configuration and overwrite `<load>` section. The rest of your Tsung config will be preserved.

Example:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: tsung
  concurrency: 100
  hold-for: 5m
  scenario: sample
  
scenarios:
  sample:
    script: tsung/http_simple.xml
```

Note that Tsung doesn't support `throughput` and `ramp-up` options.

Here's the example of various HTTP requests features that Taurus supports:

```yaml
scenarios:
  features:
    default-address: http://blazedemo.com  # base address for HTTP requests

    think-time: 1s  # delay to make after executing this request, applies to all requests, default value is 0

    timeout: 3s  # TCP connection timeout, applies to all requests, defaults value is infinity
    max-retries: 1  # max TCP reconnect retries number, defaults to 1

    headers:  # global headers, applies to all requests
      User-Agent: taurus-tsung

    requests:
    - /  # shorthard form

    - url: /reserve.php  # full form with specified method
      method: GET

    - url: /
      think-time: 3s  # overrides scenario-level think-time option

    - url: /submit.php  # POST request with body
      method: POST
      body: 'request-body-string'

    - url: /submit.php  # PUT request with file body
      method: PUT
      body-file: path/to/file.bin
      
    - url: /  # request with additional headers
      headers:
        Authentication: Token 142857
        Referer: http://gettaurus.org/docs
```

## Module Settings

If you have installed Tsung in non-standard location (i.e. `tsung` is not in your `$PATH`), you can use `path` option
to point Taurus to the `tsung` executable.

```yaml
modules:
  tsung:
    path: /usr/local/bin/tsung
```

## Tsung Concurrency Stats

Due to some limitations of Tsung, Taurus is able to extract actual concurrency info from Tsung only once in 10 seconds,
so virtual users / time graph is not completely accurate.
