# Apache Benchmark Executor

## About
[Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) is a tool for benchmarking your HTTP server.
Taurus supports the following features of Apache Benchmark:

 - `iterations`: number of requests to make
 - `concurrency`: number of multiple requests to make at a time (defaults to 1).
 - `hold-for`: run load testing for specified duration
 - `timeout`: maximum number of seconds to wait before the socket times out
 - `headers`: headers to attach to HTTP request
 - `keepalive`: use HTTP KeepAlive feature (you can use it on two levels - global for whole scenario and local for some requests)

Keep in mind the following rules when using `executor: ab`:
 - You cannot specify more than one request in `requests` section.
 - Apache Benchmark supports only GET requests.
 - `timeout` option is not supported.
 - You should have Apache Benchmark installed.

## Scenario Samples

Simplest working example:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: ab
  scenario: simple

scenarios:
  simple:
    requests:
    - http://blazedemo.com/
```

Example of `hold-for` and `timeout` usage:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: ab
  hold-for: 30s
  scenario: simple

scenarios:
  simple:
    timeout: 1s
    requests:
    - http://blazedemo.com/
```

Complex example:
```yaml
execution:
- executor: ab
  concurrency: 20
  iterations: 1000
  scenario: complex
  

scenarios:
  complex:  
    keepalive: false
    headers:
      Content-Type: text/plain
    requests:
    - url: http://blazedemo.com/
      headers:
        X-Answer: 42
```


## Module Settings

If you have Apache Benchmark in non-standard location, use `path` option to point Taurus to the `ab`:

```yaml
modules:
  ab:
    path: /home/john/build/apache2/bin/ab
```
