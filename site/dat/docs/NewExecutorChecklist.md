    * [ ] List of features
    * [ ] Configuration examples
    * [ ] Notes and specifics
* [ ] Mention new executor to `site/dat/docs/Index.md` and `site/dat/docs/ExecutionSettings.md` 
* [ ] Add `.change` file to `site/dat/docs/changes/`


## Miscellaneous

* [ ] Update `Dockerfile` and verify that Docker build works
