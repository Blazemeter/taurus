# Getting Started

Many angles and many ways to use it

When you need to set single/couple options - it makes less sense to create config file for that, better use command-line overrides.

Security - donâ€™t postpone it.

Most of options have sane defaults - you don't have to specify all you see in config examples

Scripting in YAML has its limits

You have to learn YAML (or use JSON)

Scenarios
Execution

Modules - a bit advanced

Reporting - when you go for automation

Services - when you go even further for automation
