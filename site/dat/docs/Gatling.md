# Gatling Executor

Gatling is load testing tool which most famous as choice for testing of HTTP servers.
 
In Taurus you have two way for run it: with native gatling script or with usual Taurus features: `requests`, `iterations`, etc. In last case scala script will be generated automatically.  

## Run Gatling Tool

```yaml
---
execution:
- executor: gatling
  scenario: sample
  
scenarios:
  sample:
    script: tests/gatling/BasicSimulation.scala
    simulation: tests.gatling.BasicSimulation
```

The `simulation` option is canonical class name for main simulation class. It will be passed as-is to gatling with `-s` option.

## Load Configuration

 Taurus supports possibility to send values of execution options `concurrency`, `iterations`, `ramp-up` and `hold-for` to Gatling test script. Below you can see example of usage these parameters on the Gatling side:
 
```
 package mytest

import io.gatling.core.Predef._
import io.gatling.http.Predef._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

class BasicSimulation extends Simulation {

  val httpConf = http
    .baseURL("http://blazedemo.com/")

  val scn = scenario("Extra").exec(
          http("request_1").get("/")
      )

  val t_concurrency = Integer.getInteger("concurrency", 10).toInt
  val t_ramp_up = Integer.getInteger("hold-for", 1).toInt
  val t_hold_for = Integer.getInteger("ramp-up", 1).toInt

  setUp(scn.inject(rampUsers(t_concurrency) over (t_ramp_up))
    .protocols(httpConf)).maxDuration(t_ramp_up + t_hold_for)
}
```

## Building Test Script from Config

 If your scenario don't contains `script` parameter and contains at least one element of `requests` Taurus will build scala script for test. This script will be placed in `[artifact-dir](ConfigSyntax/#Top-Level-Settings)`: you can modify it and use with Gatling later. 
 
 Following abilities are supported: `default-address`, `requests`, `headers` on scenario and request levels, `body` of request, `think-time` and params that described in `[Load Configuration](#Load Configuration)`. 
 Some asserts can be added to request. Assert describes templates and area for search (`contains` and `subject` accordingly), regexp and inverse marks. You can look for particular response code in `http-code` part or for string and regular expression in `body` of request.
 Next yaml example shows the way these features can be used and ready to conversion to scala automatically:

```yaml
---
execution:
- executor: gatling
  iterations: 15
  concurrency: 3
  ramp-up: 2
  hold-for: 10
  scenario: complex_sample
  
scenarios:
  complex_sample
    default-address: blazedemo.com
    headers:
      HEADER_1: VALUE_1
      HEADER_2: VALUE_2
    requests:
    - url: /
      assert:
      - contain:
        - .+sometext.+  # expression for assertion (mandatory)
          subject: body # subject for search (defalut: body)
          regexp: true  # whether expression is regular (default: false)
          not: true     # invert condition (default: false)          
      body: 'Some Body Data'
      headers:
        HEADER_11: VALUE_11
    - url: /reserve.php
      think-time: 2s
      assert:
      - contains: 
        - 200
        subject: http-code
        not: true
```
## Configuration Options

 Similar to other modules there is possibility of global configuration Gatling Executor by write some lines in `gatling` branch of modules setting. Next options can be set:
 - `path`: "/somepath/folder/bin/gatling_executable"
    Path to Gatling executable.
    If no Gatling executable found, it will be automatically downloaded and installed in "path".
    By default "~/.bzt/gatling-taurus/bin/gatling.sh".
    
 - `java-opts`: string with some java options for Gatling
     
 - `download-link`:"http://somehost/gatling-charts-highcharts-bundle-{version}-bundle.zip"
    Link to download Gatling.
    By default: "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/gatling/highcharts/gatling-charts-highcharts-bundle/{version}/gatling-charts-highcharts-bundle-{version}-bundle.zip"
    
 -  `version`: "2.1.7"
    Gatling version, 2.1.7 by default

 - `properties`: dictionary for tuning of gatling tool behaviour (see list of available parameters in gatling documentation). Following example shows setting output buffer size:
        
```yaml
---
modules:
  gatling:
    properties:
      gatling.data.file.bufferSize: 512  # output buffer size, 256 bytes by default      
```
## External Java Libraries Usage

Thanks to Taurus you can use additional Java classes in your scala code. For this add required jar files or contained dir to `files` list:
```yaml
---
execution:
- executor: gatling
  concurrency: 10
  hold-for: 1h
  scenario: example
  files: 
  - first.jar
  - second.jar
  - folder_with_jars
scenarios: 
  example:
    script: my_file.scala
    
## Gatling 2.2.0 Support

Taurus works with Gatling 2.2.0. However, with Gatling 2.2.0 it's not possible to extract such network stats
as latency and connection time, as Gatling removed them from report data. Because of that, Taurus installs Gatling 2.1.7
by default.
