# ShellExec Service

This service module is used to call arbitrary commands during test execution stages.

Sample configuration:
```yaml
services:
- module: shellexec
  prepare:  
  - mkdir /tmp/test
  startup:
  - echo 1 > /tmp/test
  - echo 2 > /tmp/test
  shutdown:
  - cat /tmp/test2 
  post-process:
  - rm /tmp/test1
  - rm /tmp/test2
execution:
- scenario: tg1
  hold-for: 10s
scenarios:
  tg1:
    requests:
    - label: HTTP Request
      method: GET
      url: http://127.0.0.1/
```

Extended task configuration sample:
```yaml
services:
- module: shellexec
  prepare: # stage names: [prepare, startup, check]
  - command: echo 1 > /tmp/1.txt && sleep 1 && dmesg | grep pci  # task command
    background: true  # wait for task completion or send it to background, false by default. 
    ignore-failure: true  # false by default, otherwise will shutdown tests if command return code != 0, 
    out: taskout.txt  # set file name for task stdout, null to print to stdout
    err: taskerr.txt  # set file name for task stderr, null to print to stdout
    run-at: local  # provisioning level to limit command usage, null to run always
    cwd: artifacts-dir  # option to change working dir for command, null to not change it
                        # special value 'artifacts-dir' will change to taurus artifacts dir
    env:  # environment variables to set for command
      VAR1: val1
      VAR2: val2
```

Minimum task configuration sample:
```yaml
services:
- module: shellexec
  prepare: ls -la
  startup:
  - pwd
  - echo something
```

Notes:
 - Non-background tasks are not allowed on startup stage.
 - Background tasks will be shut down forcefully on mirror stages (see [Lifecycle](Lifecycle.md)) if they were not finished yet.
 - Background tasks on Check stage will not start until same previous task completed.
 - Special environment variable `TAURUS\_ARTIFACTS\_DIR` is set for every command, containing path to current artifacts directory
 - Special environment variables `TAURUS\_EXIT\_CODE` and `TAURUS\_STOPPING\_REASON` is set for every command after
 Taurus begins shutdown, containing exit code and possible failure explanation

##Module Settings
Some 'global' settings can be specified in the `modules` block as usual.
There are `default-cwd` for `shellexec` module that allows to change `cwd` default value for all tasks
and `env` which contains dictionary for additional environment variables for commands
```yaml
modules:
  shellexec:
    default-cwd: /tmp
    env:
      VARNAME: value
      VARNAME2: value2
```

 ##Provisioning Context Configuration
 By default all tasks will be handled on the host where test is executed. In `Cloud Provisioning` case you ask (locally)
 to run test in the BM Cloud and all task will be executed there. It's possible to specify target provisioning
 for tasks or module settings, just use provisioning nicks for that:
```yaml
services:
- module: shellexec
  prepare:
  - command: echo # will be executed with test together
- module: shellexec
  cloud:
    prepare:
    - command: kill_them_all # only on your local host when you start cloud test
```
