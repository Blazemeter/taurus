This reporter is enabled by default.

Console reporter has the following settings:

```yaml
modules:
  console:
    # disable console reporter
    disable: false  # default: auto
    
    # configure screen type
    screen: console
    # valid values are:
    # - console (ncurses-based dashboard, default for *nix systems)
    # - gui (window-based dashboard, default for Windows, requires Tkinter)
    # - dummy (text output into console for non-tty cases)
```

You can also disable this reporter by using [command-line](CommandLine.md) `-o` switch:
```bash
bzt config.yml -o modules.console.disable=true
```
There is 'auto' value for the `disable` parameter - console will be turned off if tty isn't found on the STDOUT side (e.g. output is intended for CI system)

On Windows, Console Screen is shown in separate window and users may change font size by holding
Ctrl key and using mouse wheel. Two additional options are `dummy-cols` and `dummy-rows`, they
affect the size of _dummy_ screen that is used by `dummy` screen.
