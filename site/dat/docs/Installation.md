# Installing and Upgrading

Keep in mind that some additional software can be required depend of test type.

## Windows

There are two ways to install Taurus on Windows. The **recommended** way is to use the prebuilt installer
that will install latest Taurus on your PC. Also, if you already have Python installed,
you can install Taurus manually with pip, Python package manager, but this is not recommended.

### Installing Taurus With Prebuilt Installer

Download an [installer](RELEASE_SNAPSHOT) and run it on your system. It will install
local Python 3.7 and Taurus with all its dependencies.

Notes:
- You can use `/S` option of the installer to perform silent installation.

After the installation is finished, you can run Taurus with `bzt` from command prompt. Also, you'll have 'Taurus'
shortcut in the Start menu.

If you want to install additional Python packages along with Taurus (for example Locust, Molotov or others),
you should utilize the following command line utilities provided by the installer:
- `bzt-pip` is a wrapper for pip that can be used to install packages, for example `bzt-pip install locust`
- `bzt-run` can be used to launch packages that were installed with `bzt-pip`, for example `bzt-run locust locustfile.py`

Notes:
- You need to install fresh `setuptools` and `wheel` before installing everything else with `bzt-pip`, so the command is
  `bzt-pip install setuptools wheel`.

### Installing Taurus Manually

####  Install Taurus System Dependencies

1. Get Python 3.5+ from [http://www.python.org/downloads](http://www.python.org/downloads) and install it, don't forget to enable "Add python.exe to Path" checkbox.
1. Get latest Java from [https://www.java.com/download/](https://www.java.com/download/) and install it.

#### Install Taurus Python Dependencies

Open Command Prompt with administrative privileges (find `Command Prompt` in main menu and chose `Run as administrator`
from context menu). Then run the following command to update Python package manager to the latest version:
```
pip install --upgrade pip wheel
```

#### Install Taurus

```
pip install bzt
```

This should install all Taurus dependencies and Taurus itself. You may have to execute this command as an administrator,
if that's how your Python installation handles Python packages.

### Upgrading Taurus

To upgrade Taurus, open Command Prompt as administrator and run
```
pip install --upgrade bzt
```


## Mac OS
### Install Homebrew Package
You can use [brew](https://brew.sh/) package manager to install taurus:
```bash
brew install bzt
```
and to update it:
```bash
brew upgrade bzt
```
If your brew auto update is switched off don't forget to manage it manually.


## Linux

You will need Python 3.5+ and Java installed. To install Taurus on Linux, do the following instructions:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 default-jre-headless python3-tk python3-pip python3-dev \
  libxml2-dev libxslt-dev zlib1g-dev net-tools
sudo python3 -m pip install bzt
```
Upgrading to latest is as simple as this:

```
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade bzt
```

Alternatively, you can install using virtualenv, and you will not need sudo privileges for Taurus. Please see [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) instructions for setting up your Python virtual environments, if you haven't done so already.

Then, to install Taurus, type:

```
pip install bzt
```

Upgrade is only:

```
pip install --upgrade bzt
```

## Docker Image

Taurus has [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/blazemeter/taurus/) that allows you to run tool as container.

To use it, create a directory, for example `/tmp/my-test`, put all configs and additional files like JMXses there, then start Docker like this:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/my-test:/bzt-configs blazemeter/taurus my-config.yml
```

Make note that `/tmp/my-test` was passed in `-v` Docker option, it's crucial. Here's [what happens](https://github.com/Blazemeter/taurus/blob/master/Dockerfile) inside the container:
 1. Directory `/tmp/my-test` is mounted as `/bzt-configs`
 1. Current directory changed to `/bzt-configs`
 1. Taurus is started with the config files you specified: `bzt /bzt-configs/my-config.yml

You can also specify multile config files in the `docker run` command with wildcards or as separate arguments like so:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/my-test:/bzt-configs blazemeter/taurus *.yml

sudo docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/my-test:/bzt-configs blazemeter/taurus my-config-1.json my-config-2.json
```

### Additional Taurus Command-Line Options

You can still pass [command-line options](https://github.com/Blazemeter/taurus/blob/master/site/dat/docs/CommandLine.md) to Taurus through the Docker image. To do so, add the command line option at the end of the `docker run` command like so:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/my-test:/bzt-configs blazemeter/taurus my-config-1.yml -o scenarios.sample.data-sources.0=data.csv
```


### Accessing Taurus Artifacts
If you want to receive Taurus artifacts from container, just mount some directory as `/tmp/artifacts` and files will get there. Following example gives you artifacts in `/tmp/my-run-artifacts` directory.

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /tmp:/bzt-configs -v /tmp/my-run-artifacts:/tmp/artifacts blazemeter/taurus
```

We have [Usage Statisctics](/bzt-usage-stats) on our website. That's why we collect the name of desktop OS, where you have run Taurus.
