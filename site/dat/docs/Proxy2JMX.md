# Proxy2JMX Converter

It's possible to convert existing Selenium scripts into JMeter JMX file. Keep in mind: only requests will be converted, no assertions or other logic. 
For this purpose Taurus uses [BlazeMeter Recorder](https://guide.blazemeter.com/hc/en-us/articles/207420545-BlazeMeter-Recorder-Mobile-Recorder-) so you need valid token. This service starts proxy for logging requests and build jmx file based on the requests when test is finished. Lets see example config:
```yaml
---
execution:
- executor: selenium
  iterations: 1
  scenario: sel

scenarios:
  sel:
    script: example.java

services:
- module: proxy2jmx

modules:
  proxy2jmx:
    token: <your_token>

```

After execution it you'll find JMX in artifacts dir with the name `generated.jmx`.
As only Linux supports setting proxy through environment variables, you have set up another systems for work with proxy2jmx manually. Info about proxy parameters (port and address) you can find in your BlazeMeter account or in the Taurus log.
