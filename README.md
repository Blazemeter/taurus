## Purpose
Hides the complexity of performance and functional tests with an automation-friendly convenience wrapper. Taurus relies on JMeter, Gatling, Locust.io, Grinder and Selenium WebDriver as its underlying tools. Free and open source under Apache 2.0 License.

## Fork Purpose (3dgiordano)
Improve the current support of Selenium Webdriver, providing support for more selenium commands, remote-webdriver support and other functionalities commonly used in selenium scripts.
The improvements made will be proposed to the Taurus team, as long as they are not proposed and accepted, they have my fork to take advantage of and use all the new features incorporated.

running engine
...
```

## The master documentation starts here

## Installation or Upgrade

Just install it using PyPi:

```bash
sudo pip install bzt
```

More detailed instructions for Linux, Mac OS and Windows available [here](http://gettaurus.org/docs/Installation.md).

## Getting Started

Create a file named `test.yml` with following contents:

```yaml
---
execution:
- concurrency: 10
  ramp-up: 1m
  hold-for: 1m30s
  scenario: simple
  
scenarios:
  simple:
    think-time: 0.75
    requests:
    - http://blazedemo.com/
    - http://blazedemo.com/vacation.html
```

Then run `bzt test.yml`. After the tool finishes, observe resulting summary stats in console log (more reporting options [here](http://gettaurus.org/docs/Reporting.md)). All artifact files from the run will be placed in the directory mentioned in console log. Read more on command-line tool usage [here](http://gettaurus.org/docs/CommandLine.md).
